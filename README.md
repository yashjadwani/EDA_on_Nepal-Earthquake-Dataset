# Exploratory Data Analysis of Nepal Earthquake Dataset 

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Nepal Earthquake Dataset. The dataset is split into two files: input_feature.csv which contains the input features, and target_value.csv which contains the target values.

## Dataset Description

The Nepal Earthquake dataset contains information about buildings that were affected by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The input features include information about the building's location, its characteristics, and whether or not it has certain types of superstructures. There is also information about the legal ownership status, the number of families living in the building, and whether or not the building has a secondary use.

The target value is the damage grade of the building, which is a categorical variable with three possible values: 1 represents low damage, 2 represents a medium amount of damage, and 3 represents almost complete destruction.

## Files

* input_feature.csv: contains the input features for each building.
* target_value.csv: contains the target value (damage grade) for each building.
* Data Description.pdf: contains feature description. 
* Nepal_Earthquake_dataset_EDA.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Nepal_Earthquake_dataset_EDA.pdf: Pdf file of the Jupyter notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook Nepal_Earthquake_dataset_EDA.ipynb contains the code for the Exploratory Data Analysis. The notebook includes sections on data cleaning, data preprocessing, preliminary data analysis, and exploratory data analysis with research questions with data visualization.

## Summary
The Nepal Earthquake dataset provides information about buildings affected by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The EDA in this repository helps to understand the dataset and answer research questions about the factors that contribute to the damage grade of the buildings.
